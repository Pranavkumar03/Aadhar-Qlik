# Aadhaar Data Analysis Project
## Introduction

This project investigates the potential of Qlik to analyze Aadhaar data, India's unique identification system. The goal is to extract valuable insights to inform policymaking, enhance service delivery, and understand demographic trends.

## Purpose
The primary objectives of this project include:

Enhancing understanding of Aadhaar demographics and operational aspects.
Informing policy by providing data-driven recommendations for better governance.
Optimizing public services by identifying areas for improvement based on data trends.
Promoting transparency through accessible visualizations of Aadhaar data.
Supporting research by aiding analysts in understanding the impact and reach of the Aadhaar system.
## Technical Architecture
The project incorporates secret Aadhaar data into Qlik's platform for preprocessing, modelling, and visualisation. Qlik's advanced analytics tools, including as dashboards, reports, and visualisations, enable interactive exploration and insight development. Robust data governance and security procedures maintain the validity and integrity of Aadhaar information throughout the analytic process.

## Problem Understanding
The Aadhaar Card, a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the UIDAI, is the core of India's universal identity infrastructure. This project uses Qlik Sense to extensively analyse Aadhaar data in order to provide actionable insights for decision-making, policy formation, and operational efficiency inside the National Identity Authority.

## Business Requirements
The study intends to provide valuable insights into client profiles, authentication trends, and compliance indicators. It focuses on creating visually appealing interactive dashboards to help with strategic planning and operational development.

## Literature Survey
The literature review entails reviewing prior studies, publications, and reports on Aadhaar analysis. This includes searching academic sources and government papers to learn about new breakthroughs in Aadhaar analysis.

## Social and Business Impact
